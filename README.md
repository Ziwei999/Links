The topic of my website is the mirror in art and media. For this Links project, I got inspiration from the Surrealism style. When I researched mirrors in art and media, I found that most of the mirrors are shown in installation art. So I am considering how to present the mirror in digital art or 2D space. I found that many Surrealism artworks use mirror elements. Surrealism uses the unconscious mind to express itself and create illogical or dreamlike scenes and ideas through art. So, I use the Surrealism style to design my website. I want to create a dream, fantastic mirror world. I use Adobe Illustrator to create the SVG by myself and I use flip cards to show the block's content making it reflect like a mirror.
